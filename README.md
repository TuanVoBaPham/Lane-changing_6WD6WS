**Sliding Mode Control (SMC) with Extended State Observer (ESO)**

This repository contains Simulink simulation models for an autonomous vehicle lane-change control project using Sliding Mode Control (SMC) combined with an Extended State Observer (ESO).
<br>
The project focuses on robust lateral vehicle control during lane-change maneuvers under modeling uncertainties and external disturbances.
